# Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterzhu2118/algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterzhu2118/algorithms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/peterzhu2118/algorithms/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/peterzhu2118/algorithms)

## About
This repo contains some of the commonly used general purpose algorithms that can be used for teaching, contest preparation, projects, etc. This is project is currently still in beta phase and more algorithms will be added soon.

## Requirements
The algorithms are all written and tested aginst Java SE8, as some things used are SE8 specific, so not all algorithms will work as expected on SE7. I may port these algorithms to other languages in the future.

## Issues
If any bugs are found, please leave them in the issues section and (if you are able to provide a solution) leave a pull request (see "Contributing" section below for more details).

## Contributing
If you have any algorithms to add, fix any bugs, or any other sort of improvement, please do a pull request so I can review, provide feedback, and merge into the repo. Please aim for your pull request to pass the integration test, unless there is a bug with the test script.
